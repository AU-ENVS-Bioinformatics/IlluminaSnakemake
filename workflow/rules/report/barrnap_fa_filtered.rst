Barrnap predicts the location of ribosomal RNA genes in genomes. It supports bacteria (5S,23S,16S), archaea (5S,5.8S,23S,16S), metazoan mitochondria (12S,16S) and eukaryotes (5S,5.8S,28S,18S).
This file contains the 16s sequences after filtering those below a minimum (default 900pb) in fasta format.
